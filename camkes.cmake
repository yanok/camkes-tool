    configuration at runtime.

    Standard -> Standard error handling mechanism, that is configurable by the user at
    runtime. See the documentation for details of the API for this.

    Guards -> Use verification-visible guards at the site of each potential error.
    Note that this assumes that none of the error conditions are possible.
    If you are trying to verify code, you will be forced to prove that none
    of the error conditions can ever actually occur.

    Abort -> Call 'abort' inline when an error occurs. For debugging purposes, this
    is probably not the behaviour you want as it will give you no
    information about the error. The standard error handling mechanism has
    a nicer default for debugging. This mode is primarily useful when you
    want to verify code whose error handlers are unreachable for
    non-trivial reasons.

    Discard -> Perform the 'discard' action on any error that occurs. The advantage of
    this over simply configuring this behaviour via the standard mechanism
    is that you will not need to reason about any of the complicated error
    handling structures or control flow. This has no implementation
    advantages over the standard mechanism."
